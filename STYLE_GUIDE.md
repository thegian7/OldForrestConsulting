# Copy Style Guide

Write like a person. Be direct, clear, and honest.

## Voice

- Active, not passive
- Confident, not salesy
- Specific, not vague

## Formatting

- No em-dashes
- No emoji in copy
- Short paragraphs

## Grammar Patterns

**Do:**
- "X is Y" (simple copula)
- "We built X" (active voice)
- "The system handles Y" (direct subject)

**Don't:**
- "X serves as Y" / "X stands as Y" (just say "is")
- "We don't just X; we Y" (negative parallelism)
- "From X to Y, from A to B" (false ranges)
- "X, Y, and Z" when forced into threes

## Review

Read your copy out loud. If it sounds like marketing fluff, rewrite it.

Tools like [humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) can help catch generic or AI-generated content.

## Files

Copy lives in:
- `components/*.tsx`
- `lib/case-studies.ts`
- `app/layout.tsx`
