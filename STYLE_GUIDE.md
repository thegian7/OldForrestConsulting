# Copy Style Guide

Write like a person. Be direct, clear, and honest.

## Voice

- Active, not passive
- Confident, not salesy
- Specific, not vague

## Formatting

- No em-dashes
- No emoji in copy
- Short paragraphs

## Review

Read your copy out loud. If it sounds like marketing fluff, rewrite it.

Tools like [humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) can help catch generic or AI-generated content.

## Files

Copy lives in:
- `components/*.tsx`
- `lib/case-studies.ts`
- `app/layout.tsx`
